This project detects Arecanut leaf diseases using a CNN (Deep Learning Model).
You can upload a leaf image, and the system will tell you whether it is:

Healthy Leaf

Leaf Spot Disease

Yellow Leaf Disease


The project has:

🧠 Machine Learning model

⚙ FastAPI backend

🌐 Simple HTML/CSS/JS fronten


📌 How It Works

1. User uploads an image of a leaf
2. FastAPI receives the image
3. CNN model predicts the disease
4. Frontend displays the result and confidence
